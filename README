This is my first puppet repo, which runs on
a network of VirtualBox nodes I setup on my laptop.

This repo contains the whole of /etc/puppet, so it should
be usable as is. 

OS support is limited to CentOS/RHEL for now,


site-specific bits are under manifests/
(hopefully) reusable bits are under modules/

Don't go using this as any kind of reference, I am
still a noob (although slowly getting the hang of it).


It's intentionally basic (Keep It Stupid, Simple).

There are far smarter people writing puppet modules on github if
you need something complex.
