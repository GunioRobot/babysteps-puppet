General rules of thumb for puppet layout
(not necessarily true yet, will be amended as we go).

general
- no editing of any files outside /etc/puppet on puppetmaster
  (use "custom" module to add types/facts/providers to the nodes;
  set modulepath etc. in puppet.conf to live under /etc/puppet on master)
- everything to be git versioned
- stock (EPEL) RPMs only. Use 'localrepo' module for 3rd party bits.

modules
- module for each bit of functionality
  (files/templates etc. to be served from there)
- README per module; describe dependencies and assumptions
- definitions.pp holds custom defines for a module
- any customs types/definitions should support 'ensure => absent'

'toplevel' files
- roles.pp describes inheritance hierarchy
- nodes.pp assigns roles to hosts
- virtual resource are realised (not in modules themselves)
- global variables set in the node defns (so overridable)

manifests
- line up your arrows
- 2 space indentation

files
- Files notify Services only if required (e.g. they need a reload)
- Files modes are readonly to discourage local edits
- Files contain a comment explaining they are Puppet controlled

dependencies
- Packages notify Services
- Services require Packages
- Files require Packages
  (saves us having to create e.g. /etc/snmp by hand; let RPM do it)
