This is a general module to distribute custom
types, facts and providers via plugins to puppet nodes.

Although functions run on the puppetmaster, they use Facts
from the clients, so this can be pretty useful.

you'll need to 'include custom' in your nodes
(or edit their puppet.conf by hand, see files/ subdirectory)
to load this modules plugins.
